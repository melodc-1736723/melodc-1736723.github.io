            About Shine
            <br>
            <br>
            Pentagon will be coming back on April 2nd with the 6th mini album “Positive”. Before that, 
            Pentagon released “Shine spoiler” and 3 short videos, which sparked people’s anticipation 
            towards their new songs. In the first publicized spoiler video, there is an appearance of 
            electric guitar playing the melody of “Shine”. Following in the second publicized spoiler 
            video, Pentagon member Wooseok is featured whistling to the same tune. In the last publicized 
            video, a piano is shown playing the same tune from the previous videos. These unique spoiler 
            videos sparked an intense anticipation towards their new song. With Pentagon’s comeback of the 
            6th mini album, a refreshing concept, “nerd look” image teasers, and three videos showing the 
            melody, these various comeback spoilers piqued interest among the fans, raising anticipation. 
            The title song “Shine” talks about loving someone but is unable to express it due to a lack of 
            confidence, so the person can only linger around their loved one, making it a song about 
            unrequited love. Through the main piano riff and minimal rhythm, the song gives off a pleasant 
            and bright charm.
